    "You roll up on your toes, bouncing, when you're happy.",
    "You tuck your head when you're unsure.",
    "You click softly while you sleep.",
    "You dedicate yourself, fiercely.",
    "You laugh when you don't know what to say.",
    "You say nothing when you don't want to talk.",
    "You walk very straight, and very quickly when you're angry.",
    "I've seen other people do that stuff too.",
    "But I never cared much, because those are your things."
