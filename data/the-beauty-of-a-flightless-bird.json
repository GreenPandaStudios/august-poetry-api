    "The beauty of a flightless bird,",
    "whose wings have never been opened,",
    "whose songs are of no spoken word,",
    "whose food has always been broken.",
    "The beauty of a crawling child,",
    "whose legs have no need to scurry",
    "from light in fear it may be seen,",
    "and goes nowhere in a hurry.",
    "The flightless bird has sweeter songs",
    "than melodies of ones who soar.",
    "For, flightless, having seen no wrongs,",
    "its hymns are meant to be adored.",
    "The crawling have the purest laugh,",
    "one not stained with memories",
    "of walks that wander off the path,",
    "and scars from constant jeopardy.",
    "Yet, birds must fly,",
    "and people, go.",
    "It's fine to cry.",
    "it’s loss; I know.",
    "What once were wounds,",
    "have become scars.",
    "For when life blooms,",
    "Death isn’t far.",
    "All skin is tinged",
    "with nicks and cuts.",
    "All feathers thinned",
    "in violent gusts.",
    "When birds first flew",
    "and people left,",
    "Through tears, you knew",
    "‘twas for the best."
