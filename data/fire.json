    "All fire starts with a spark, a burst of sudden joy.",
    "From spark comes flame, has it a name, flame is its ploy.",
    "While we shiver, a spark dies quicker, than the flame in which we seek.",
    "When it dies, to our surprise, the spark has made us weep.",
    "But sometimes flame has a name, spark where it began.",
    "And when spark dies, we dry our eyes, for flame is now the plan.",
    "Flame starts small, it can barely crawl, but wait and it will grow.",
    "Sometimes we rush, and flame we hush, because we chose to blow.",
    "But wait some do, when flame is new, and bigger it becomes.",
    "The dark and cold, flame does scold, as it starts to hum.",
    "Hum turns to roar, and flame needs more, fuel in which to live.",
    "Sometimes it dies, by compromise, fuel we didn’t give.",
    "But in death, flame has breath, burning coals of fire.",
    "Though flame is dead, the coals of red, still contain desire.",
    "Potential still, we have until, the coals begin to fade.",
    "But soon comes cold, no one to hold, for light has turned to shade.",
    "What I fear, are bitter tears, to make the red coals none.",
    "What I fear, is that my ears, mistakenly heard a hum.",
    "What I fear, is that it’s clear, flame did not embark.",
    "Most I fear, is to hear, that there was never spark."
