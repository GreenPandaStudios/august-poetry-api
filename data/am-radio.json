    "the ground sway",
    "in the sum of life",
    "of wind and fish and sun",
    "and the child playing on the beach",
    "and in all my dreams",
    "and in all your dreams",
    "in Tuesday afternoons",
    "when there's nothing to say",
    "and in early December mornings",
    "when we can't speak."
